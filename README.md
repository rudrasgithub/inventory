## 🚀 System Overview

This inventory management system is designed to handle all aspects of modern business inventory operations, from basic product tracking to advanced analytics and reporting. The system features a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop customization, real-time data updates, and comprehensive mobile support.

## 📦 Core Modules

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

Comprehensive security system with JWT-based authentication and email verification.

**Available Endpoints:**
- `/api/auth/login` → User login with JWT token issuance
- `/api/auth/signup` → New user registration
- `/api/auth/forgot-password` → Request password reset, sends OTP to registered email
- `/api/auth/otp-verification` → Verify OTP received via email
- `/api/auth/reset-password` → Reset password after successful OTP verification

**Protected Routes:**
The following routes require valid JWT authentication:
- `/` → Home Dashboard
- `/product` → Product Management
- `/invoice` → Invoice Management
- `/statistics` → Sales & Purchase Analytics
- `/setting` → Account Management

**Security Features:**
- Email uniqueness validation
- Forced logout on email/password updates
- Session management with automatic token refresh
- Protected API endpoints with authentication middleware

### 📦 Product Management

The Product Management module serves as the core of inventory tracking, where all product information is displayed and managed efficiently.

#### � Product Attributes

Each product in the system contains the following attributes:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Name** | The name of the product (e.g., "Apple iPhone 14") |
| **Price** | Price of a single unit of the product |
| **Quantity** | Current stock available in numbers |
| **Threshold Value** | Minimum stock level set for the product. Helps trigger Low Stock alerts |
| **Expiry Date** | The date after which the product is considered expired |
| **Availability** | Auto-calculated status based on Quantity & Threshold |

#### ✅ Availability Status (Auto-Calculated)

The system automatically calculates product availability based on business rules:

- **In Stock** → `Quantity > Threshold`
- **Low Stock** → `Quantity ≤ Threshold` but `> 0`
- **Out of Stock** → `Quantity = 0`
- **Expired** → Cron job runs daily and marks products expired. Expired products appear in red with quantity auto-set to 0

#### ⚙️ Product Management Features

- **Add / Edit / Delete Products** → Complete CRUD operations for inventory management
- **Bulk Upload (CSV)** → Import multiple products in one go (CSV excludes images)
- **Upload Modal Management** → Modal closes automatically if user clicks outside it
- **Backend Pagination** → Smooth performance even with large datasets
- **Advanced Search** → Search products by name, category, or supplier (processed on backend)
- **Quick Order Modal** → Clicking on a product cell opens a modal where users can:
  - Enter additional quantity to order
  - Confirm purchase with automatic quantity updates

#### 🔴 Empty State Handling
When no products exist, the table displays: **"No products available."**

#### 📱 Add New Product Form

When adding a new product, the following fields are available:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Product Image** | Upload by dragging an image or browsing manually |
| **Product Name** | Enter the product's name |
| **Product ID** | Unique identifier for the product (user-specific) |
| **Category** | Select the category (e.g., Electronics, Groceries) |
| **Price** | Price per unit |
| **Quantity** | Initial stock available |
| **Unit** | Measurement unit (e.g., pcs, kg, liters) |
| **Expiry Date** | Expiration date in dd-mm-yyyy format |
| **Threshold Value** | Minimum stock before product is marked Low Stock |

**Form Actions:**
- **Discard** → Cancel product creation
- **Add Product** → Save product details and add to inventory

### 🧾 Invoice Management

The Invoice Management module allows businesses to create, track, and manage invoices efficiently with comprehensive status tracking and reporting.

#### 📊 Dashboard Metrics (Invoice Overview)

| Metric | Description |

| **Processed (Last 7 Days)** | Represents the total views per unique invoice |
| **Paid Amount (₹)** | Total value of all invoices marked as Paid |
| **Customers (Last 7 Days)** | Number of paid transactions completed in the last 7 days |
| **Unpaid Amount (₹)** | Total outstanding invoice amount pending |
| **Ordered (Unpaid Section)** | Same as Unpaid Amount, reflecting the sum of all unpaid invoices |
| **Pending Payment** | Count of invoices currently in Unpaid status |

#### 📑 Invoices List (Table View)

Each row in the invoice table contains comprehensive information:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Invoice ID** | Unique identifier auto-generated on invoice creation |
| **Reference Number** | Generated when an invoice is marked as Paid (empty until then) |
| **Amount (₹)** | Total cost of all products in the invoice |
| **Status** | Unpaid (default) / Paid (on confirmation) |
| **Due Date** | Auto-set to 10 days from invoice creation |

**Table Actions:**
- **View Invoice** → Open the Invoice Template for detailed breakdown
- **Mark as Paid** → Updates status, assigns Reference Number
- **Delete Invoice** → Invoice can be deleted whether Paid or Unpaid

#### 🖨️ Invoice Template (Detailed View)

When a user opens an invoice, a detailed invoice template is displayed:

Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted
```
*Solution:*
- Enable 2FA on Gmail and generate app password
- Verify SMTP settings in `.env` file
- Check firewall settings for SMTP ports

#### Frontend Issues

**Issue: API Calls Failing (CORS)**
```bash
Access to fetch at 'localhost:5000' from origin 'localhost:5174' has been blocked by CORS policy
```
*Solution:*
- Verify backend CORS configuration
- Check `VITE_REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` environment variable
- Ensure backend is running and accessible

**Issue: Chart Not Rendering**
```bash
Error: Cannot read property 'getContext' of null
```
*Solution:*
- Verify Chart.js dependencies are installed
- Check console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure chart container has proper dimensions

**Issue: Drag & Drop Not Working**
```bash
Drag functionality not responding on mobile
```
*Solution:*
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Disable browser extensions that might interfere
- Test on different browsers/devices

### Development Debugging

#### Enable Debug Mode

**Backend Debug Logging:**
```bash
# Add to .env file
DEBUG=app:*
NODE_ENV=development

# Start with debug output
npm run dev
```

**Frontend Debug Mode:**
```bash
# Add to .env file
VITE_DEBUG=true

# Check browser console for detailed logs
```

#### Database Query Debugging
